# Simple Gulp Starter

Based on the gulpfile in [Lemonade](http://lemonade.im/). I wanted to create a simple starter for me to base my projects on. As I learn Gulp more this package will probably grow but for now it will mostly serve to compile sass and update browsersync.

## Instructions (for dummies like me)

1. Download files into your project folder. See [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11497457/git-clone-without-git-directory?lq=1).
2. Run ´npm install gulp´
3. Modify gulp as you wish and run it
4. Happy camping!
